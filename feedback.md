## Remarks
- Code: no oop and huge try statement, not a good practice. It's not clean (no typing, no docstring)
- notebooks ok
- No useless branches on github :thumbsup:
- Good git usage :fire: but try not pushing so many similar commits 
- dataset absolute path hardcoded in dashboard, gave an error while launching and using streamlit. Use relative path instead
- Good idea to create a streamlit :fire:
- The presentation was not as good as it could have been, I understand working as a team is not always an easy task but you managed to present something it's already positive.
- Analysis was good and insights relevant
